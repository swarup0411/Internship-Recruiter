# Internship-Recruiter
This model will be able to predict whether the candidate has been shortlisted for interview or not and if not shortlisted, it would be able to inform his/her skill gap based on the desired role and skill set provided by the candidate. This has been done by the use of the pandas library of python and basic coding in python for data cleaning.
